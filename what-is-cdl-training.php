<h1>What is CDL Training?</h1>

<p>CDL training prepares you for a career as a professional truck driver. To become a truck driver an individual is required to acquire a CDL; Commercial Driver's License. The U.S. Department of Transportation; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration division sets guidelines for CDL drivers. Each state, in turn, puts additional requirements in place.</p> 

<p>To obtain a CDL, a knowledge based test and a skills based test, that includes safety inspection parameters, and equipment operation are mandatory. In many states, the skills test is conducted by the DMV; Department of Motor Vehicles. In other states, a tractor trailer driving school instructor, military or government personnel may be authorized to conduct the road test and inspection requirements.</p> 

<p>The best way to begin CDL training is contact a truck driving school, and find out how to get enrolled. Roadmaster Drivers School offers CDL training to start a career as a professional truck driver. With over 20 years of experience, knowledge, and 12 locations across the U.S., they can get you enrolled and off to a good start on the road to your new career.</p> 

<p>In order to earn a CDL, a driver must score at least 80% accuracy on the knowledge test, and perform all of the required tasks for the skills test. Walking into a DMV and paying hard earned money to take the tests without proper training through a truck driving school, would most likely result in a waste of time and money.</p> 

<p>Federal regulations are strictly enforced. Without the prior experience and training in this specialized field, a novice will, in most cases, fail the test to acquire a CDL. At Roadmaster Drivers School, a student will learn how to drive a tractor trailer, couple and uncouple a trailer, track driving and down time through log management, perform pre-trip and post-trip inspections, and document any equipment issues during the course of a day with a DVIR; Driver Vehicle Inspection Report. These are just some of the skills you will learn through hands-on training available at one of their 12 locations nationwide.</p> 

<p>Truck driving is one of the most flexible career choices around, due to the variables within the industry. In the next decade according to the U.S. Department of Labor, transportation is one of the top growth oriented industries out there. The Labor Statistics Bureau reports the average wage for a heavy tractor trailer driver; CDL Class A, around $18.24 hourly. This averages out to around $40,000 per year. Actual wage is based on specialized freight, and additional endorsements against the CDL. An endorsement is a specialized skill and knowledge acquired within the industry. An example of this type of endorsement is a hazardous material or tank endorsement.</p> 

<p>Becoming a truck driver is possible with the right driver training school behind you. With their solid reputation in the field, Roadmaster Drivers School can help you become a professional truck driver with as little as 3 to 4 weeks of specialized hands-on training behind the wheel. Personal knowledge builds confidence, and the skills learned at Roadmaster, their financial assistance program, and job placement assistance program will have you on the right path in a short amount of time. CDL training will help you achieve these goals.</p> 

<p>A key factor in becoming a truck driver is your ability to look for work wherever you live. There are many jobs you could apply for, if only you held a CDL. After completing your truck driving school training, these jobs will be within your grasp. Even though all states have some differing CDL requirements, with regards to testing, a CDL driver can find work in transportation anywhere.</p>
