 <h1>Team Truck Driving is a great way to start your truck driving career!</h1>
 
<p>Team truck drivers not only share a cab, they share all the responsibilities normally handled by a single truck driver. Husband and wife truck driving teams are among the happiest and most satisfied truck drivers on the road. Consider this truck driving couple, a husband and wife long-haul driving team:</p>
 
 <div class="testimonialSmall">"Team driving is something we talked about doing for a long time... things could not be better. We are happier &amp; have more money in the bank than we ever thought possible."<br /><span class="testimonialAuthor">John and Kelly M.</div>


<h3>Opportunity for team truck drivers to cover more miles and make money faster!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Team Drivers do this by staggering their sleep schedules and supporting each other on the road.</li>
	<li>One husband and wife driving team buys each other their favorite snacks at truck stops along the way!</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Trucking companies can offer team drivers benefits such as:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Top Pay</li>
	<li>Bonus Programs</li>
	<li>Awards for Safe Driving</li>
	<li>Health and Life Insurance</li>
	<li>Vacation Pay</li>
	<li>Retirement Plan</li>
</ul>


<h3>Travel the country and get paid for it!</h3>
<p>Being an OTR (over the road) truck driving team is just one of the many options open to Roadmaster graduates. Your Roadmaster instructor may even be able to introduce you to carrier companies that favor team drivers. All you and your partner need to do is <a href="/contact.php">sign up!</a></p>
