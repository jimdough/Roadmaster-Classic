        <p>Dear ##NAME##,<br><br>
        <a href="http://www.roadmaster.com" target="_self">Roadmaster Drivers School</a> wants to make sure that all of our graduates had a great experience attending our school and have found gainful employment in the transportation industry. We also understand that when you hit the road with your new career sometimes addresses, phone numbers and other contact information may change. That is why we are asking that you fill out a quick survey for us. Roadmaster wants to continue to train quality drivers. We can only do this by hearing from our students on what we did right and where we could use some improvement.</p>
        
        <p>Please take just a couple minutes to fill out the survey as well as join your fellow graduates on our <a href="facebook.com/RoadmasterDriversSchool" target="_self">Facebook</a> page and by following Roadmaster on <a href="http://twitter.com/roadmastercdl" target="_self">Twitter!</a></p>
        
        <p>Thanks again for taking the time to keep us up to date and keep on trucking!</p>
