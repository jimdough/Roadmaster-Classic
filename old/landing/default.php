 <h1>The state of the trucking industry today and in the future</h1>

	<p>The trucking industry is actively seeking drivers and is ready to hire. More over, driving jobs are predicted to be in high demand far into the future. The American Trucking Association estimates we need to recruit qualified drivers to fill an expected shortfall of 111,000 drivers by 2014**.</p>

	<p>There will always be a need to move freight and consequently a need for professional truck drivers to move that freight. Over the years, a common misconception has developed that the industry is old fashioned and stuck in the past. That impression couldn't be further from the truth. Heres why:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Trucking is a high-tech industry and the use of computers and trucking software is extremely popular. The top trucking companies are constantly upgrading trucks with better systems, improved aerodynamics and stronger and lighter materials.</li>
	
	<li>The average salary of truck drivers in 2010 was $37,770, which is greater than many other occupations that require similar skill levels and training requirements including construction workers, heavy equipment operators and forklift operators***.</li>

	<li>A majority of professional drivers are able to get home weekly to their families</li>

	

	<li>Truck drivers haul 71 percent of all freight moved throughout the U.S.</li>

	<li>The trucking industry employs one in every 19 people in the U.S.</li>

	</ul>

	<h1>What if the trucks don't move?</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>The country would experience food shortages in three days</li>
	<li>NO drinking water in 2 to 4 weeks</li>
	<li>NO large scale emergency medical supplies</li>
	<li>NO automobile travel after 1 week</li>
	<li>NO cash at ATM machines in two days</li>
	<li>Widespread trash and sanitation problems</li>
	</ul>
