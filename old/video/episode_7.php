 <h2>What are some of the issues that a trucking companies may look at when doing a background check?</h2>
 
 <p>Most companies have different hiring standards that may or may not include ever having a felony or maybe having a felony that's 5 years old or that's 10 years old or never having a DUI to having a DUI that is 10 years old. So they have different standards, but most companies as far as moving violations, I guess the average across the board would probably would be two moving violations in three years may preclude you from being hired.</p>
