 <h2>How often does a truck driver need to make entries into their logbook?</h2>
 
 <p>All hours of service for a driver need to be recorded, not necessarily in a logbook, short haul operations or city operations, as long as the driver is working out of one terminal or one work location and returns to that location everyday and doesn't drive over a hundred mile radius, he wouldn't need to record it in the logbook but his company would need to record it somehow or another on a time sheet. All drivers have to maintain or have someone maintain their hours of service, to make sure they don't exceed the hours of service regulations.</p>
