   <h3>Getting the Benefits Started</h3>
    <p><img style="padding:10px; padding-top:0;" src="/images/olderVet.jpg" align="left">In order to get the benefits started, the veteran or other eligible person will need to file an appropriate application.  For veterans who have never used their benefits, the appropriate application is VA Form 22-1990 or VA Form 22-5490 for other eligible dependents.  For veterans who have used their benefits previously, the appropriate application is VA Form 22-1995 or VA Form 22-5495 for other eligible dependents. Please have the veteran or other eligible person submit the appropriate application over the Internet. This will ensure that there will be no interruption in Muskogee receiving the application. The applications can be found at www.gibill.va.gov. There is a link on the front page to apply for VA education benefits. In addition to the veteran or other eligible dependent completing an application, you must complete an enrollment certification form (VA Form 22-1999). 
</p>
