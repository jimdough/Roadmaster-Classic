 <h3>What You Can Expect from Class A CDL License &amp; Class B CDL License training at Roadmaster  Drivers School!</h3>

Our strength working with the top trucking companies becomes your benefit. <b>We are invested in your success.</b></p>
 
 <p>You can expect hands-on<a href="trucking_benefits.php"> truck driving</a> classes, a special focus on CDL license training, CDL license exam material and tuition assistance for those who qualify. Several trucking companies offer tuition reimbursement for <a href="trucking_benefits.php">truck driver training</a> programs. For those who qualify, a variety of trucking companies will pre-hire students and reimburse training costs for as long as they are that company's employee. <b>You'll have CDL training courses lasting only 3-4 weeks</b> with free job placement assistance after graduation!</p>
 <p>Since April 1, 1992, all truck drivers have been  required to have a CDL license in order to drive a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_motor_vehicle" target="_blank">Commercial Motor Vehicle</a>.    A <strong>Commercial Driver's License</strong> (<strong>CDL</strong>) is required in the United States to operate any type of vehicle which has a gross vehicle weight rating (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVWR" target="_blank">GVWR</a>) of 26,001 lbs  or over for commercial use. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Highway_Administration" title="Federal Highway Administration" target="_blank">Federal Highway Administration</a> (FHWA) has developed testing standards for licensing drivers. States are able to issue a CDL License only after a written and driving test have been given by the state or approved testing facility. The minimum age to apply for a CDL license is usually 21, as required by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation" title="United States Department of Transportation" target="_blank">US Department of Transportation</a>,  although some states may allow drivers who are 18-20 to apply for a CDL  that is valid only within the driver's state of residence. A single state CDL license only restricts driving of CMVs within the holder's  state (not non-commercial vehicles), and automatically converts to a 50  state CDL license at the age of 21.</p>
 <h3>What type of CDL License should you train for?</h3>
 <p> Since April of 1992, all drivers have been required to have a CDL in order to drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle. Operation of   these commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), which are primarily tractor-trailers requires advanced skills and knowledge above and beyond those required to drive a car or other light weight vehicle.</p>
 <p> Most states offer both <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">Class A CDL license</a> and Class B CDL license.</p>
 <ul>
   <li> A <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">Class A CDL License</a> is needed to operate any combination of vehicles with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVWR" target="_blank">GVWR</a> of 26,001 or more pounds provided the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVWR" target="_blank">GVWR</a> of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds
     <ul>
       <li>Vehicles requiring a Class A CDL license   are primarily tractor-trailers.</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   <li>A Class B CDL License is needed to operate  any single vehicle with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVWR" target="_blank">GVWR</a> of 26,001 or more pounds  or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVWR" target="_blank">GVWR</a>.
     <ul>
       <li>Vehicles requiring a Class B CDL license may include   buses (regardless of size), passenger vans, motorhomes, standard-sized dump trucks, tow trucks, cement mixers, delivery vans, garbage trucks, utility vehicles and any single truck with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, cars and cars with trailers.   </li>
       </ul>
   </li>
   </ul>
<?php include("/inc/cta.inc"); ?>
<p> In the United States, training may be obtained by completing a qualified CDL training program through a training school such as <b>Roadmaster Drivers School</b>. <b>Roadmaster</b> specializes in teaching potential truck drivers the necessary skills and knowledge to properly and safely operate a truck, including map reading, trip planning, and compliance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation" title="Department of Transportation">Department of Transportation</a> laws, as well as backing, turning, hooking a trailer, and road driving. Our primary focus is to help future truckers pass the CDL knowledge and skills tests as well as advanced driving techniques such as skid avoidance and recovery and other emergency actions for situations such as a break away trailer and hydroplaning. <b>Roadmaster's</b> classes usually go well beyond the training the typical non-commercial driver receives, such as the drivers education provided in high school. </p>
